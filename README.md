A collection of 363 examples of C++ code found in "Starting Out with C++ Eight Edition" By Tony Gaddis, coded by hand. 
many examples include data structures such as linked list, binary trees, stacks, and queues.
many examples also include algrotihms for searching and sorting, as well as traversing data structures.
many examples also include object oriented project specs that can be better viewed through the header file section at the bottomn of the repo.
The goal was to familiarize with the concepts and the syntax of C++ as well as develop more general 
understanding of data structures, algorithms, and object oreinted design principles.
